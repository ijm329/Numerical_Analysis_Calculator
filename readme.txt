Numerical Analysis Calculator Readme

My project is a calculator that allows the user to input an expanded polynomial expression and it 
shows the user the derivative and integral of the function as polynomial expressions. 
It also allows users to evaluate the derivative of a function at a point, which allows them 
to get the rate of change of the function. The program also allows the user to evaluate the 
integral of the polynomial over a given boundary, and it also lets the user find the root of
the function, or the zero of it near a given x value. The program also allows the user to graph
the function, the derivative, and the integral on the same graph. The user can zoom in and out 
by updating the x and y increments on the graph and they can toggle the functions that they would
like to see by using the check buttons to turn them visible or invisible. 

Installation and Running:

This program can be run by using an editor. No special modules or libraries were used for this project
so it does not require any such installations. The libraries and modules used are all built into python.
Since my project was made on Sublime Text 2 for Windows 64 bit computers, the indentation becomes erroneous 
when opened on IDLE, so it would be best to open it on Sublime Text 2. However, to open it on IDLE, open the 
program, press ctrl+a to highlight all of the text, go to format -> Untabify Region. In the box, enter 4, and hit okay.
Then, ctrl+f self.drawTitleScreenBackGround, highlight the entire command, go to Format -> dedent region, and then 
repeat one more time. Afterwards highlight all of the two functions below it and dedent them only once so that they
are in line with all of the other functions. The program will then run on IDLE. For sublime, simply run it.
